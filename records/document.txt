--Both Lombok and records helps us to reduce boilerplate code
--records -> Immutable date carrier in java, this class is only about data, Nothing else.

public record UserDto(Long id,
                    String name,
                    String email) {

                    }

--in record
    -all variable are by default private final
    -by default parameterized constructor is there
    -by default equals(), hashCode() and toString() method is there.

    --there are no setters and mutable state.
    --records don't just reduce boilerplate, they forces better design.
    --records cannot extend other class.
