main operation hash and equals.

Q) what data structure HashMap returns
    --HashTable data structure

Q)Which datastructure is used to implement HashMap in java
    --Array and LinkedList

Q)Is HashMap thread-safe in Java?
    --No, HashMap is not thread-safe.
    --multiple Threads can use our HashMap object simultaneously.

Q)What Happen if you use HashMap in a multithreaded Java application
    --when multiple Threads try to access the HashMap at same time then they try to modify data at same time.

Q)How do you remove a mapping while iterating over HashMap in java?
    --remove() of iterator
    code:
        Iterator itr = map.entrySet().iterator();

        while(itr.hasNext()) {
            Map.Entry current = itr.next();
            if(current.getKey().equals("Matching")) {
                itr.remove();
            }
        }

Q)What is loadfactor in HashMap?
    --Number that control resizing of the HashMap(Table or Buckets).
    --initial value 0.75

Q)How many entries you can store in HashMap? What is the maximum limit?
    --No limit for HashMap
     size() return int
     JDK 8 resolve by adding mappingCount() return long value.

Q)what is the difference between the capacity and size of HashMap in Java?
    --capacity: How many entries HashMap can store.
    --size: entries currently present.

Q)What is ConcurrentHashMap in java?
    --A Map implementation, Which can be safely used in a concurrent and multithreaded Java Program.

Q)what is the difference between HashTable and ConcurrentHashMap in Java?
    --Performance and Scalability of ConcurrentHashMap is high as Compared to HashTable.
    --ConcurrentHashMap-> Segment level locking
    --HashTable -> Whole object is locked

Note:
    keys can't be duplicate, values can be duplicate
    --when multiple thread have same Map object and try to do operation at same time then ConncurrentModificationException occur.
